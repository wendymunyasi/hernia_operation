# Hernia Operation
This module describes the hernia operation using code. It provides an implementation for performing a hernia repair operation. It includes a class Incision to represent a surgical incision and several functions to simulate the steps in a hernia repair procedure, including creating the incision, pushing the herniated organ back into place, repairing the weakened muscle, and closing the incision. Note that this module is purely for demonstration purposes and the information contained within is not accurate or to be used for any specific purpose.


## Technologies
* Python scripts interpreted/compiled using python3 (version 3.8.5).
* Python scripts use **pycodestyle** (version `2.8.*`).
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.


## Installation
The module can be downloaded and imported into your project as follows:

```
import hernia_operation
```


## Usage

### Creating an Incision
To create an incision, call one of the following functions based on the hernia location and surgical technique:

```
incision = hernia_operation.make_incision(site, technique)
```

The `make_incision` function returns an instance of the `Incision` class.

### Pushing the Herniated Organ Back
To push the herniated organ back into place, call the following function:

```
organ = hernia_operation.push_organ_back(incision)
```

The `push_organ_back` function returns the organ that was pushed back into place.

### Repairing the Weakened Muscle
To repair the weakened muscle or tissue, call the following function:

```
muscle = hernia_operation.repair_muscle(incision, technique)
```

The `repair_muscle` function returns the muscle or tissue that was repaired.

### Closing the Incision
To close the incision, call the following function:

```
result = hernia_operation.close_incision(incision)
```

The `close_incision` function returns a message indicating that the incision has been closed.

### Performing a Hernia Operation
To perform a hernia repair operation, call the following function:

```
result = hernia_operation.hernia_operation(site, technique)
```

The `hernia_operation` function simulates a hernia repair procedure by creating an incision, pushing the herniated organ back into place, repairing the weakened muscle, and closing the incision. The function returns a message indicating the success of the operation.


## Example
Here's an example of how to use this module to perform a hernia repair operation:

```
import hernia_operation

site = 'abdomen'
technique = 'open'

incision = hernia_operation.make_incision(site, technique)
organ = hernia_operation.push_organ_back(incision)
muscle = hernia_operation.repair_muscle(incision, technique)
result = hernia_operation.close_incision(incision)
result = hernia_operation.hernia_operation(site, technique)
```
